Credit card Dashboard Power BI<br />
Project Objective: To develop a weekly dashboard providing real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends for credit card operations.<br />
Dataset: Customer dataset with customer details (customer.csv) and Credit card data showing their credit usage info (credit_card.csv) is used<br />
Steps:<br />
1.	Project Overview & Planning-<br />
•	Defined the business problem: Analyze credit card customer and transaction data.<br />
•	Identified key KPIs: Revenue trends, customer segmentation, utilization ratios, and delinquency rates.<br />
2.	Data Extraction & Integration-<br />
•	Imported customer and transaction data from a SQL Database using SQL queries.<br />
•	Combined multiple datasets (CSV files) into Power BI using Power Query.<br />
•	Ensured data integrity: Validated data types, checked for nulls, duplicates, and consistency.<br />
3.	 Data Cleaning & Transformation-<br />
•	Performed data cleaning using Power Query (removed nulls, fixed headers).<br />
•	Created custom columns using DAX: Age Group, Income Group, Week Number.<br />
•	Calculated revenue, acquisition costs, and week-on-week revenue changes.<br />
4.	Data Modeling & DAX Calculations-<br />
•	Established relationships between tables.<br />
•	Created calculated columns and measures (e.g., Total Revenue, % Change WoW).<br />
•	Used DAX functions like SWITCH(), WEEKNUM(), IF(), and DIVIDE() for advanced logic.<br />
5.	Dashboard Development-<br />
•	Designed two dashboards:<br />
i)	Credit Card Customer Report<br />
ii)	Credit Card Transaction Report<br />
•	Incorporated filters by Gender, Income Group, Card Type, and Quarter.<br />
•	Applied clean formatting: Color themes, visual hierarchy, and responsive layout.<br />
6.	 Visualization Customization-<br />
•	Used bar charts, stacked columns, KPIs, and slicers for interaction.<br />
•	Added titles, data labels, tooltips, and legend formatting for clarity.<br />
•	Created a weekly trend analysis view for actionable insights.<br />
7.	Weekly Updates & Automation-<br />
•	Integrated additional data files for weekly refresh.<br />
•	Ensured dynamic updates with Power BI’s Refresh functionality.<br />
•	Highlighted trends using automatically updated week-over-week metrics.<br />
Key Insights-<br />
  a. Total revenue generated in the year is 56.5 million out of which 45.5 million was total transaction amount and around 8 million was from interest. <br />
  b. Majority of customers fall in the age group 40-50, indicating a middle-aged target audience.<br />
c. Revenue is highly generated by customers of Blue card category, with swipe being preffered.<br />
d. Customers who are graduates or in high school contribute to more revenue along with those who are businessman or have white-collared job.<br />
e. Customers with high income range contribute more to the revenue. customers in less, mid and high income group use credit card often for bill payments whereas elite customers pay more for travel purposes.<br />
6. Total revenue shows a slight drop in months of march- April which could be due to financial year end.<br />
7. Delinquency is more prevalent among the ₹1L–₹2.5L income group, signaling potential credit risk. Customers aged below 25 show higher default trends—may require stricter underwriting.<br />
8. Recommend focusing future campaigns on the 40-50 age group, especially in urban tier-1 regions.
